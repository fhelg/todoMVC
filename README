# todoMVC

This is a sandbox projet to test frontend MVC technologies I expect to use in my future projet. It is inspired by http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/. 

The application will use the following technologies

* Coffeescript as a replacement for Javascript
* Backbone.js for the MVC structure
* Require.js to structure the code even more
* Mustache.js as templating language
* JQuery for dom manipulation and animation stuffs
* SASS as style sheet techo
* localstorage.js to store data in the browser
* HTML5 to build the web page

In a second time, I'll also try to add a Rails backend to the application to test the integration of these technologies with Rails.
